# IEE-CIS-Fraud-detection

In this competition, we will detect online fraudulent transactions using machine learning techniques. Our objective is to implement a solution that comes under the top 5% in Kaggle leaderboard which is not an easy task. IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection is a Kaggle competition organized by the IEEE Computational Intelligence Society. Vesta Corporation who is one of the forerunners in guaranteed e-commerce payment solutions provided the dataset for this competition.


### Business Objective

The main business objective of finding fraud transactions can be following:
* If a fraud transaction is found out, the company should immediately block that card.
* We should be able to predict the probability of fraud transaction
* We should not predict fraud transactions as nonfraud. Also the vice versa. So precision and recall should be taken care of.

### Results
After creating some baseline models we stick up with xgboost as it was giving better perfomance. We did several feature engineering and feature selection and ultimatly end up with a solution which is top 3.5% in kaggle leaderboard. The progress in our project is as follows:
